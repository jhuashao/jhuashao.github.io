            This case study rethinks the current model of translation inside of WeChat, China’s largest digital
            communications application.

            The study was conducted through a custom design sprint framework, and consisted of six phases that
            ultimately informed an alternative solution to WeChat’s existing translation design pattern.
            <br>
            <br> This project was completed within the span of five days as a design exercise.

            WeChat’s current translation functionality is buried in cumbersome, inflexible user interface design
            patterns:
            “翻译” functionality is hidden from initial tooltip menu view, and requires multiple steps to access it
            translated text stays permanently in a message bubble, and users must manually remove them
            <br>
            <br>
            As more and more Chinese individuals are conducting business internationally, studying abroad, and becoming
            progressively more globalized, WeChat is doing a disservice to their primary users through poor
            functionality in an important aspect to their application.
            <br>
            <br>
            By rethinking this functionality, WeChat could solve for a low-risk, high-yield design opportunity.
