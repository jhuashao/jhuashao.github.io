            This case study rethinks the current model of translation inside of WeChat, China’s largest digital
            communications application.

            The study was conducted through a custom design sprint framework, and consisted of six phases that
            ultimately informed an alternative solution to WeChat’s existing translation design pattern.
            <br>
            <br> This project was completed within the span of five days as a design exercise.

            WeChat’s current translation functionality is buried in cumbersome, inflexible user interface design
            patterns:
            “翻译” functionality is hidden from initial tooltip menu view, and requires multiple steps to access it
            translated text stays permanently in a message bubble, and users must manually remove them
            <br>
            <br>
            As more and more Chinese individuals are conducting business internationally, studying abroad, and becoming
            progressively more globalized, WeChat is doing a disservice to their primary users through poor
            functionality in an important aspect to their application.
            <br>
            <br>
            By rethinking this functionality, WeChat could solve for a low-risk, high-yield design opportunity.

            I conducted two 45-minute user interviews to get to know their  thoughts on the two prototype solution’s

            I hoped to develop a clearer picture on which prototype was a stronger candidate, and observe potential gaps

          Additionally, users have an option to double tap the floating action button for a robust, full-screen
          translation experience. This eliminates the need for users to switch applications for translation
          functionality altogether.

          Wechat’s current translation functionality is unwieldy, permanent, and inaccessible. Translations create a
          completely separate message entirely, and remain in the chat indefinitely.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, if users need more information regarding a specified translation, they’d have no choice but to
          leave the WeChat application and resort to another third-party translation service.
