                        Slack Lightening is a prototype extension of the communication application, Slack that allows for users to communicate with
                        one another without interrupting workflow. Rather than open up the full desktop app to reply to quick
                        questions, Lightning allows for users to reply to questions without leaving their current screen
                        by utilizing the menu bar and notification widgets.

                        and understanding. Also the handoff would always lead to questions and me sitting next to the developers
                        helping them work through the design, like for example I would make the UI, do a markup and documentation,
                        and then give it to a developer. No matter how well or efficiently I made the documentation, the
                        devs always had questions, and I didn't always have the time to hover over them and guide the code.""

                        In my personal experience, consistent communication between team members is very important for the success of a project.
                        However, it can sometimes be very distracting and pull me away from crucial work for something that
                        is at present more urgent but of lesser importance.

                        a full shift in attention and application. The current model for professional communication doesn’t
                        allow for long, sustained periods of focused work.

                    <br> Slack is the leading corporate software for communication across teams, and building off their functionality
                    was a way I could scope a viable solution for this challenge given the time restraint of four days.

                    <br> Slack Lightning operates extremely quickly and provides instantaneous messaging and response features.
                    For both sender and receiver, users can communicate at high speeds without completely having their attention
                    hijacked and workflow put on pause.

                        Within the design workflow, communication is a vital key feature that speeds up the timeline of projects dramatically. By
                        exploring instantaneous communication without intrusive interfaces, this concept could be pushed
                        forwards to free us of our love of sticky applications.
                        <br>
                        <br> This model has potential to become its own standalone, lightweight application. Leaning on Slack
                        as a base study was useful to help flesh out functionality, but isn’t necessary to push the concept
                        further. I’d be interested to see what new ideas can stem for a tool such as this.

                        This four day design sprint taught me so much about prioritization and execution. Certain elements had to fall by the wayside
                        ot make room for mission-critical arguments in my finalized solution. It was a great experience working
                        within the parameters of a design sprint challenge, and I learned how to critically prioritize and
                        execute different elements of my study.
