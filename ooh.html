                        of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It draws upon government data to provide users with information
                        regarding career options, growth, salary, benefits, and much more. The link to the current website
                        can be found here:

                        <br> My redesign incorporates traditional graphic design principles that allow for an overall better
                        user experience. The color palette now features a muted blue that alternates with each hero, organizing
                        the reading experience for the user. The navigation through the site is linear, with emphasis to
                        the fold of the screen, affording scrollability for the user. Lastly, I chose Google’s Noto Sans
                        for it’s broad language support, being that users may come from other non-English speaking backgrounds.

                    Tackling an entire website redesign would require an entire team of designers, developers, copywriters, and project managers.
                    Rather than attempt to completely revamp the OOH, I decided to wireframe several key features of the
                    website, and focus on the homepage of the site, allowing me to lay the foundations of new opportunities
                    that the website currently lacks.

                    <br>
                    <br> The OOH is a fantastic resource, but it’s strongest function, Search, wasn’t being fully utilized by
                    the website. With this layout I made sure the search had a full hero catered towards this. The layout
                    also highlights “Featured Occupation” and “Select Occupations By” which allow users to use other methods
                    of finding the exact information that they need.

                    <br> Following a cleaner layout and more organized look, my redesign allows users to navigate their search

                    This project for the Occupational Outlook Handbook was focused towards a visual redesign with graphic design principles of
                    hierarchy, typography, and color being applied to guide the user through editorial experience. The project’s
                    goal was to develop a prototype that could help solve core usability issues through implementation of
                    grid and proper use of typography.
                    <br>
                    <br> In the future, I’d hope to be able to conduct proper user testing to fully flesh out a complete website
                    redesign, which would allow me to continue to iterate designs based off of concrete validation.
